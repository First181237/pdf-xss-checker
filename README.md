## Overview

**pdf-xss-checker** is a powerful Node.js tool designed to scan PDF files for potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. As PDF files become increasingly popular for sharing information, ensuring their security is crucial. This tool analyzes embedded scripts, forms, and suspicious content to help identify security risks in PDFs before they are distributed or displayed in browsers.

### Why Use PDF XSS Checker?

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks can lead to serious security breaches. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in PDF files to execute malicious scripts, potentially compromising users' systems. With pdf-xss-checker, you can:

- Detect embedded scripts that may pose a risk.
- Analyze forms for potential security issues.
- Identify suspicious content before it reaches users.

## How It Works

pdf-xss-checker employs a series of checks to identify vulnerabilities in PDF files:

1. **Script Analysis**: The tool scans for any embedded JavaScript or other scripting languages that may execute in a browser context.

2. **Form Inspection**: It examines forms within the PDF to ensure that they do not contain fields that could be exploited for XSS attacks.

3. **Content Evaluation**: The tool looks for suspicious content that may indicate a security risk, such as unusual links or unexpected JavaScript calls.

4. **Reporting**: After scanning, pdf-xss-checker generates a report detailing any vulnerabilities found, along with recommendations for remediation.
